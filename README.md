##Bulldog Taxi
*CT Limo isn't the only way to Yale*

We aim to create a service for Yale Students to arrange to split taxis to and from Bradley International Airport. Bulldog Taxi will give these travelers a quick and easy alternative to CT Limo.

Eventually, Bulldog Taxi might extend beyond Bradley, enabling students to coordinate rides from Laguardia, JFK, and other locations. It may even expand beyond Yale.
